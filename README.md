# odin-tic-tac-toe

This is a tic tac toe game meant to be played by two players. The goal of this project was to dive into ruby's OOP, hence why we have a board and main class. To play, just run $ruby main.rb with the most up to date version of ruby.

Classes

    Board:
        The board class keeps track of the current round and stores information like the current board, players playing, and information needed for calcuations. This is where a round is run.

    Player:
        the player class stores information like the players name, whether they are currently X or O, and their score.
